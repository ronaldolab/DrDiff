# Stochastic drift-diffusion (DrDiff) framework
The Stochastic drift-diffusion (DrDiff) framework can determine the coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient D(Q), the drift velocity v(Q) and the free-energy landscape F(Q) using a given single-molecule trajectory Q(t) as input. It can also resolve the mean first passage time and mean transition path time from trajectory and calculate the first passage time and the transition path time by Kramers' theory using D(Q) and F(Q) previously settled.
